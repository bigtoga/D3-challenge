              <p>It's no surprise that individuals with lower incomes (such as those below the poverty line) also have 
                a lower statistical probability of having healthcare coverage. With this graph, you can clearly see
                that Texas is a "Lone Star State" in that it is the only state that has both a "high" percentage of its population
                in poverty (17.2%) but also has the highest percentage of un-insured citizens in the country (24.9% - nearly 5 full percentage
                points above the 2nd place Mississippi).
